Blook in IO/ to find h2.py and h2_job.py
h2.py runs pyscf to calcuate RDM and energy for h2.
h2_job.sh is a bash script that submits h2.py to SLURM to run on some node

useful slurm commands
squeue -u username
slist
sbatch script.sh
scancel jobID 
###     ^ can find in squeue
i reccomend setting an alias for squeue:
alias sq='squeue -u auppgard'
# set in ~/.bashrc
